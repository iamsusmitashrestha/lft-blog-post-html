        <p>This stunning waterfall is just about 2 km away from the Pokhara airport. The major source of water of this waterfall is Phewa Lake. The name of this fall is derived from a very unfortunate incident where a woman drowned and was perished in the falls and her name was ‘Davi’. The mystery of this fall is what attracts the visitors the most as the water does not flow to a river or lagoon but into a pitch dark hole that disappears in the caves.</p>
